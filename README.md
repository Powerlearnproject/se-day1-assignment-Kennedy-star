#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry..
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
2.  The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3.  The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

i)Idea generation: coming up with an solution that can solve a problem.
 ii) Requirement Analysis: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
 iii) Product Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
iv) Product Development/Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
v) Intergration and Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  vi) Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  vii) Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.  ie Medical Software Development – Example: A hospital management system that requires clear documentation and approval
  
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. ie a Mobile App Development – Example: A social media app that evolves with user preferences.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
 - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs in Software Development
✅ Code Efficiency & Productivity – IDEs provide code completion, syntax highlighting, and templates, speeding up development.
✅ Debugging & Error Detection – Built-in debuggers help identify and fix issues efficiently.
✅ Code Navigation & Management – Features like search, refactoring, and version tracking simplify complex projects.
✅ Integration with VCS & Build Tools – IDEs often support Git, CI/CD pipelines, and project automation.
✅ Multi-Language Support – Developers can work with multiple programming languages in a single environment.

Examples of Popular IDEs
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – A lightweight, highly extensible IDE for multiple languages.
IntelliJ IDEA – Best for Java and Kotlin development.
PyCharm – A specialized IDE for Python development.
Eclipse – A widely used open-source IDE, especially for Java.
Xcode – The official Apple IDE for macOS and iOS development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

  - Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
importance of testing: help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
✅ Enhances Accuracy & Relevance – Well-designed prompts help AI generate precise and context-aware responses.
✅ Optimizes AI Performance – Structured prompts reduce ambiguity and improve AI efficiency in problem-solving.
✅ Improves User Experience – Clear and specific prompts make interactions smoother and more productive.
✅ Facilitates Complex Tasks – Helps AI perform advanced functions like code generation, content creation, and data analysis.
✅ Reduces Misinterpretation – Eliminates vague or misleading queries that could lead to incorrect AI responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a Vague Prompt:
❌ "Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
✅ "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, focusing on diagnosis, treatment, and patient management."

Why is the Improved Prompt More Effective?
More Specific – The improved prompt focuses on AI in healthcare rather than the broad topic of "technology."
Clearly Defined Scope – It directs the AI to cover diagnosis, treatment, and patient management, preventing irrelevant or overly general responses.
Concise Yet Detailed – It maintains clarity while ensuring that the response is meaningful and focused.
